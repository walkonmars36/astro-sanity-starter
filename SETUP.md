# New project setup

Cloning `astro-sanity-starter` + `sanity-studio-starter` does **not** leave
you in a runnable state. Three things are missing every time, and none of
them fail with an error that points back at what's actually wrong. Follow
this checklist in order rather than debugging from symptoms.

Assumes the usual folder structure: a parent project folder (e.g.
`client-name/`) containing `frontend/` and `studio/` as sibling clones,
each its own git repo.

## 1. Install dependencies — both repos

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../studio && npm install
```

Skipping either one gives `astro: command not found` or `sanity: command
not found`, which reads like a broken install rather than a missing step.

## 2. Create the Sanity project

```bash
cd studio
npx sanity init
```

Or via [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage) if you prefer the UI.
Note the **project ID** it gives you.

Update `studio/sanity.config.ts`:
```ts
title: 'Client Name',
projectId: '<your-new-project-id>',
dataset: 'production',
```

## 3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in:
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` — same ID as step 2
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` — `production`, unless you set up something else
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` — see step 4

Without this file, every page 500s with a generic `Configuration must
contain projectId` error from `@sanity/client` — nothing about that error
points you back to `.env`.

## 4. Generate a read token

From `studio/`:
```bash
sanity debug --secrets
```
This gives you a management token. Use it to script a read-role API token:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sanity.io/v1/projects/<projectId>/tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token from sanity debug --secrets>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"frontend-read","role":"read"}'
```
Or manually: sanity.io/manage → project → API → Tokens → Add API token →
Viewer. Paste the result into `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` in `frontend/.env`.

## 5. Seed test content

The starter's `testMessage` document type proves the frontend↔Studio
connection works, but a fresh dataset starts empty. Generate a **separate**
write-role token (Editor role, sanity.io/manage → API → Tokens), keep it
out of `frontend/.env` entirely, this is a local-only operation:

```bash
cd studio
SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN=<your-write-token> node --env-file=.env scripts/seed.mjs
```

(Node 20.6+ required for `--env-file`. On older Node, `npm install dotenv`
and add `import 'dotenv/config'` as the first line of `scripts/seed.mjs`
instead.)

Re-run any time the test document goes missing, it upserts rather than
duplicating.

## 6. Set CORS origins

sanity.io/manage → project → API → CORS Origins → Add:
- `http://localhost:4321` (or whatever port Astro actually binds to, see
  the port note below), allow credentials, save.

## 7. Run both dev servers

```bash
# terminal 1
cd studio && npm run dev

# terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Check the frontend terminal's output for which port it actually bound to.
Astro defaults to `4321`, but silently shifts to `4322`/`4323`/etc. if
that port's already taken, including by an unrelated project's dev server
running elsewhere. If Presentation mode 404s or looks dead, this port
mismatch is the most likely cause, `lsof -nP -iTCP:4321 -sTCP:LISTEN`
tells you what's actually holding the port.

For less common gotchas (trailing whitespace in folder names, named vs.
default export mix-ups, the Presentation tool's known connection-drop
bug, etc.), see the running reference doc:
